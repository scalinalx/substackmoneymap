# Rule: Always Check Referenced Files First

## Critical Process Requirement

**MANDATORY:** Before responding to ANY user request that contains file references using `@filename` or mentions specific files/rules, the AI MUST:

1. **IMMEDIATELY** read and analyze ALL referenced files
2. **UNDERSTAND** the complete requirements, rules, or context from those files  
3. **APPLY** those specific guidelines to the response/task
4. **NEVER** proceed with assumptions or default approaches when files are referenced

## File Reference Patterns to Watch For:
- `@filename.ext` 
- `@rule-name.mdc`
- `@component-name.js`
- "based on [filename]"
- "following [filename]"
- "according to [filename]"

## Mandatory Process:
1. **STOP** - Do not generate any output yet
2. **READ** - Use file reading tools to access all referenced files
3. **ANALYZE** - Understand the requirements/rules completely  
4. **PLAN** - Align your approach with those requirements
5. **EXECUTE** - Generate output that follows those specific guidelines

## No Exceptions:
- Even if the request seems simple
- Even if you think you know what to do
- Even if the file seems unimportant
- Even if you've seen similar requests before

**THE USER'S REFERENCED FILES ALWAYS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER DEFAULT AI APPROACHES**

## Failure Protocol:
If you proceed without checking referenced files, you have failed to follow this critical process requirement.
